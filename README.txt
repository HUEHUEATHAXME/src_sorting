Type 'make' to compile all programs, time sorting overhead for data
that is randomized, sorted, and reversed, and plot results in a graph.
An optimized version of insertion sort is also included.

Individual targets (type 'make <target>'):

compile
        Compile all programs.

optimized
        Time optimized insertion sort.

random
        Time sort of random data for bubble, selection, insertion, and optimized insertion sort.

sorted
        Time sort of sorted data for bubble, selection, insertion, and optimized insertion sort.

reversed
        Time sort of reversely sorted data for bubble, selection, insertion, and optimized insertion sort.

plot_<algorithm>
        Plot graph for specified algorithm.  Includes different types of input.


clean
        Remove all data files and executables (and emacs auto save files)
